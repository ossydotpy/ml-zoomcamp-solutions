# Week 8
Here's a quick snapshot of what we did:

- Explored the inner workings of convolutional neural networks, understanding what happens under the hood of a CNN.

- Learned how to train our own neural network right from scratch.

- Additionally, we delved into transfer learning, a technique where we build upon what a pretrained neural network already knows.

Exciting stuff.
